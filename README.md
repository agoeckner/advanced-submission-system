Advanced Submission System
==========================

**A "Turnin" replacement.**

The Advanced Submission System is a replacement for the venerable "turnin" assignment submission program, and its accompanying "project" assignment management system. Its aims are primarily to improve the ease-of-use of the system and to provide additional utilities for viewing and managing grades.
